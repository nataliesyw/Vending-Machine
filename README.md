# PBS system
Since I am using a MacOS system, the Phonebook.sav file saved from my program in macOS may not be compatible to Window OS.

Therefore, I could not read the PB.dat (changed to Phonebook.sav) provided by the src.

To solve this, phonebook.sav should not be downloaded at first. Then, I can create the phonebook entry on my own and the newly created file(Phonebook.sav) can be saved and read on the macOS

Also, when a window OS is used, record should be created manually firstly instead of reading in the phonebook.sav that I provided in the source
